# Contributing

Fibry welcomes contributions.

If you find a bug, please submit a bug report. A failing unit test would be much appreciated.
If you want to contribute code, if possible please contact me in advance, so we can discuss the feature before you make the pull request. Please follow java conventions and the general style of the project.

If you are using Fibry and want just talk about it, feel free to contact Luca Venturi on LinkedIn.
